Training: git rebase interactive
--------------------------------

# Context:

You are doing some work using a gitflow, github-flow or whatever similar strategy where you have feature branches or whatever you name it.

During your work day, you probably get tasks, features, assigned to you. In this case, you are going to create a feature branch and work on it.
Unfortunately, life is so unfair... And some of your coworkers are starting their assigned feature after you and finishing before! Not that you are not
fast or good enough, it's just that humans are supposed to be equals, tasks length and complexity are not! Also, as the americans would say... \*\*\*\* happens,
so your messages are not so clean now, and you're book is getting unreadable, which is annoying.

## Chapter 1: building my house

I have a pretty good idea of how to build my house. The spared money I have should be more than enough, my only issue is that I don't have a land yet.

So let's imagine I own that land, and I'm ready to start bbuilding my house.

The land is on whatever lane, whatever city in whatever country. This might be quite important for the actions to come!

Right, you know how the weather is in whatever city... So I'm starting building my home using straw, but the wind has blown everything off.

Then I tried sticks, it's wood, so should be alright, innit? In order to do that, I had to cut some trees, and as everybody knows, cutting trees is probably one of the cause of global warming...
Anyhow, because of that previous thing, I received a fireball right next to my house, buring everything down, no luck again right?
